1) As you bring in more past data the S&P 500 accuracy is decreasing 
2) More features (more no of days taken in account for predicting the next day stock) requires more data ! for low data the accuracy gets lower
3) No of hidden units should be at least 1.5 times as much as the no of input units (If 1 hidden layer)
